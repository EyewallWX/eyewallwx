#### Feeding Band/Feeder Band
A feeding band is a rare type of EWRC feature in which the outer eyewall contains a feeding band that causes energy to flow to the decaying inner eyewall, allowing it to maintain for longer. This feature is usually only evident on radar as it is microscale, and dissipates fairly quickly, most times persisting for a few hours at max.

Attached below is an example of Cyclone Zelia 2025 and Hurricane Ida 2021 (fig.2) exhibiting a feeding band.

#### Stable cirrus band
This phenomenon occurs (as far as we're aware - might be incorrect, as there are no studies on this) due to the effects of shear on strong pulses of convection in storms. If shear onset occurs right after a large convective pulse the resulting upward motion is forced sideways, producing gravity waves which show themselves in the upper levels of the troposphere as cirrus clouds.

Attached below are two examples of the cirrus band from 2024, with typhoon Krathon and cyclone Chido respectively.

#### Cirrus vortex tubes
Cirrus vortex tubes are a very rare phenomena that occur in the upper levels of the eyes of some strong (Category 4+) storms. On rare occasions after a strong VHT some cirrus may become trapped in the inner eye of a storm, and due to the extreme vorticity present form tube(s) of cirrus that slowly dissipate over the course of a few hours. These features usually only occur after a period of rapid intensification and signal extreme vorticity being present in the environment.

#### Diurnal cycle
The diurnal cycle is an extremely important process occurring in every TC. They affect different strength TCs differently, from weak bursts to massive size expansions. This is due to the latent heat release from seawater. The diurnal cycle occurs on a 24hr time loop, with the diurnal maximum (best conditions) positioned temporally near sunset to early night, and worst conditions occurring near noon.

Attached below is a graph from Dunion et. al. 2014 showing the change of solar radiation and energy emission being largely dependent on the diurnal cycle.

#### Diurnal Pulse
A diurnal pulse is a phenomenon closely related to diurnal cycles - these occur roughly around sunset in any given TCs and are characterized by a large expansion of the wind field and cloud cover of a storm. They occur due to the change in solar radiation, as well as differentiating latent heat release from the water below based on the time of day.

Attached below is a graph showing a diurnal pulse in Hurricane Sam (2021) showing a large expansion of the cloud cover, as evident in differential imagery in fig. D
