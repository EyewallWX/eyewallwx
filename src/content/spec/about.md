# About
EyewallWX is a community associating weather enthusiasts of all kinds, with varying levels of meteorological knowledge, and from all over the world with the purpose of live tracking and archiving weather events of all kinds. Regardless of political views, race or sexual orientation, everyone is welcome here and on our Discord server, where you can chat with others sharing the same interests in a casual manner. Here’s a quick summary of what we do!

Our main goal is the archive of valuable meteorological data, such as satellite imagery, recon data, or NWP model runs on our website. Moreover we will focus on posting reliable weather updates on our social media and the website, and simply connecting people with similar interests on our Discord server, where we focus on live discussion. On top of that, we have created a meteorological glossary of tropical cyclone terms, categorised into multiple tiers, which can be found here and on our Discord.

We’re actively tracking tropical cyclones and severe weather events in threads (special channels) on the server whenever a weather event notable enough to archive occurs. After the cyclone dissipates or the severe weather outbreak is over, we archive said threads (so any member can access them at any time) and write closures to summarise the event. These closures, written by our moderation team can be found here in the form of blogposts in the "archive" section, where you can filter storms by basin and year.  

Our Discord server is focused on tropical cyclone and severe weather tracking, however we offer channels for space weather, geology and other weather related topics. In other words, our Discord is a place where you can casually talk with other people sharing the same interests about various sciences (although the main topic is, of course, meteorology), share your photographs and learn more about what fascinates you. Learning is our primary driver, and even if you are new to the field, we hope to see you on the server!
