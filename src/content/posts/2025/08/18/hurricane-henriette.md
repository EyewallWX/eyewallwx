Henriette originated from a disturbance behind Hurricane Gil, slowly moving westward while remaining disorganized. By August 3rd, the system would begin showing notable organization, and by the next day, NHC would classify it as a tropical storm. Initially, Henriette had a ragged appearance, with a prominent band of deep convection to its west producing ~40kt winds.

Through the day, Henriette would slowly wrap convection around its center, thus organizing further, reaching its initial 45kt peak before running into cooler waters and beginning a slow weakening process.

Over the next days Henriette would resemble the appearance of a classic dying Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone, with fragile CBs pulsating as it traversed the 26Â°C isotherm. The storm would end up degenerating into a gale force low as it entered the Central Pacific basin.

Contrary to the conventional scenario, a quite particular environmental setup involving an ULL aided the remnants of Henriette, which restarted convective activity despite suboptimal sea surface temperatures, resulting in Henriette getting re-upgraded to a tropical cyclone. 

In its second life, the tropical storm found itself in much more permissible conditions, re-strengthening nicely as it moved over gradually warmer waters. Deep convection significantly increased, quickly building a CDO while gravity waves emanated from it's center. By August 10th, Henriette would meet RI criteria as it gained hurricane status northeast of Hawaii, becoming an anomalous, mesmerizing storm.

Henriette would spend around 42 hours as a hurricane, at first slowly weakening, but as shear sharply increased, Henriette would quickly decouple its low and mid level centers, and then proceed to degenerate a second and last time.
